# Get Next Line
The get_next_line() function in C reads a file line by line, allowing repeated calls to retrieve each subsequent line from the file or standard input. It returns the read line or NULL in case of an error or when there are no more lines to read.
This project not only reinforces core C programming skills but also requires a solid understanding of file manipulation, dynamic memory management, static variables, and compilation processes.

## Skills
### File I/O and Error Handling:
Developing the get_next_line() function requires a deep understanding of file I/O operations, especially reading lines from a file descriptor. The implementation should be robust enough to handle errors and return NULL when necessary, ensuring reliable operation in various scenarios.

### Dynamic Memory Allocation and Deallocation:
Efficiently managing memory is crucial, as the function needs to allocate memory for the lines read and free it when necessary. Skills in dynamic memory allocation and deallocation are honed through careful implementation, considering cases where the buffer size may vary.

### Understanding and Implementing Static Variables:
A key aspect of the project involves knowledge and effective use of static variables. Implementing static variables correctly ensures that the function retains information between repeated calls, allowing it to read the text file one line at a time.
